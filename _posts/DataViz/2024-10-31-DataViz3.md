## Wage Growth by Job Switcher vs. Stayer
I was told that people usually receive higher pay after changing jobs. To confirm this assumption, I explore difference in wage growth between **job switchers** (individuals who changed jobs) and **job stayer** (those who remained in the same job). The data comes from the [Wage Growth Tracker][Dataset] by Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which shows the three-month moving average of median wage growth.

## Visualization
In this visualization, I create two line charts to show the growth rate by job swticher vs. stayer. I also add a Gantt chart underneath to display the gap between two lines.

## Insights
- The chart highlights that **job switchers** (red) experience higher wage growth compared to **job stayer** (blue) in general.
- From 2000 to 2008, wage growth for both job switchers and stayers was relatively stable, though it showed a slight downward trend.
- During the period from 2008 to 2011, wage growth for both groups dropped significantly due to the Great Recession of 2008. Job switchers particularly experienced a sharp decline in wage growth. This is the only period in which the wage growth for job stayers surpassed that for job switchers.
- After 2011, both groups gradually recovered, with job switchers maintaining higher wage growth overall. There was a noticeable spike in wage growth for both groups in 2022, during the post-pandemic period, with job switchers seeing a substantial rise.
