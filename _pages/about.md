Hi there, I'm Hieu Nguyen, a senior at the University of South Florida majoring in Mathematics: Computational and Applied. Alongside my strong background in mathematics, I've equipped myself programming languages such Python, SQL, and R to break into the data field. I'm passionate about uncovering insights hidden within numbers to solve real-world problems.

I consider myself a lifelong learner with curiosity. I've have completed various online courses, from Statistics to Machine Learning, on platforms like Coursera, DataCamp, Udemy, etc.

This blog site is a collection my learning notes from my readings, school courses, personal project, etc. It's a okace where I can practice my writing skill, stay motivated and keep up with my studies.
